Lab 2: OMFGDOGS

I was able to get the background be the omfgdogs gif fairly quickly.
It took me a little while to figure out how to loop the sound in the
background. I wasn't sure whether the link to the omfgdogs page should
stay if the screen is too small, so I compromised and made the link white
which is the same background as the "No omfgdogs for you" screen. So it's
there and you can click it but you can't see it.

Dave Igliozzi helped me briefly with the screen size part.

I spent about an hour on the assignment.
