- My favorite project to work on and the one I am most proud of can be found in the 'transit' folder.
      I used json parsing and the google maps API to make a useful tool for people trying to use the
      T. It pans to your location, inputs a JSON string from another website containing line information
      (times, destinations, etc), draws the line, and tells you which station on that line you are closest
      to.

- I've grown a mongo amount since the beginning of this class. I know that I have only scratched the
      surface of web infrastructure, but the framework is there for me to continue to learn everything I
      can about how the web works. I look forward to doing that learning.
