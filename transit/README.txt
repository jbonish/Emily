Assignment 3: MBTA Map and Schedule Rodeo


NOTE: I didn't realize having silly commit messages was points off until it was too late.
		I have a couple silly ones in there. Please ignore. I was loopy from working for 
		so long that day.

Correctly Implemented Aspects: I believe all aspects were correctly implemented.

Failed Aspects: I was able to get everything to work.

Hours Spent: 10-12

I didn't collaborate much, someone helped me briefly with the closest station step.
