Assignment 2: Duck Hunt Part 1

I was able to draw everything on the canvas successfully. The background
had already been set to the correct color in the css file, but I was able
to slice the sprite sheet provided successfully and insert the correct parts
of the png onto the canvas.

What didn't work was initializing the image in draw(). I'm not sure why this
was, perhaps it hadn't loaded yet when I tried to use insertImage()? I ended
up just placing the image in the html file and set its display to none so that
it wouldn't show up until I sliced it and inserted it using insertImage().

It took me about 3 hours to complete.

I collaborated with Emily Taintor and Dave Igliozzi on this assignment.
